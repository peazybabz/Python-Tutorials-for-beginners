# define three sets
A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

# set union
print("Union of A and B is",A | B)

# set intersection
print("Intersection of A and B is",A & B)

# set difference
print("Difference of A and B is",A - B)

# set symmetric difference
print("Symmetric difference of A and B is",A ^ B)
